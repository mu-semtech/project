# Semantic.works (mu-semtech)
This repository is used to store information and track issues that apply cross-services in the full semantic.works stack.

## Getting started
If you do not know where to begin, check out any/all of the following documents:
1. Read about why and how the semantic.works stack works: [discussions - design philosophy](docs/discussions/design-philosophy.md)
2. Recognising our different project types and how they help you: [discussions - project categories](docs/discussions/project-categories.md)
3. Learn how to [create a full-fledged application](docs/how-tos/creating-applications.md) or a [microservice to support it](docs/how-tos/creating-microservices.md)
4. Learn how to ideally [deploy your applications](docs/how-tos/deploying-applications.md)
