## State-of-the-art web applications fuelled by Linked Data aware microservices

*Presentation in the Industry Track of [SEMANTICS](http://2016.semantics.cc/), September 13th, 2016, Leipzig, Germany*

The presentation introduces and discusses the mu.semte.ch framework. Our experience so far shows that the framework offers a productive way of quickly developing practical applications on top of Linked Data covering various situations and domains. Code can be extensively shared across projects in the frontend as well as in the backend which shortens the application development time drastically.

## State-of-the-art Web Applications using Microservices and Linked Data

*Paper for the [4th SALAD workshop](http://salad2016.linked.services/) at ESWC, May 29th, 2016, Heraklion, Crete*

Description of mu.semte.ch, a platform for building state-of-the-art web applications fuelled by Linked Data aware microservices. The platform assumes a mashup-like construction of single page web applications which consume various services. In order to reuse tooling built in the community, Linked Data is not pushed to the frontend.

## An Ecosystem of User-facing Microservices supported by Semantic Models

*Position paper for the [5th International USEWOD Workshop](http://usewod.org/usewod2015.html) at ESWC, May 31st, 2015, Portoroz, Slovenia*

Microservices promise to vastly simplify application complexity. Tiny applications offering  
very specific functionality are easy to build and maintain. But how do you keep your  
models in sync? Is there a way to share the microservices between parties? By leveraging  
the power of semantic technologies, we can create an ecosystem in which many  
microservices complete a unified model. A small semantic web to be used within an  
organization. This lets organizations have a taste of semantic technologies cheaply with  
minimal risk. Our strategy gives focus on supporting single page web applications, where  
javascript and REST API’s are king. In this short position paper we describe an  
architecture for building, combining and sharing user-facing microservices for state-of-the-  
art web applications.
