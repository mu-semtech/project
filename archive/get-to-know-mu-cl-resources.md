# Get to know mu-cl-resources
Long awaited, but itâ€™s finally there: [a README for the mu-cl-resources service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources). Get to know all features (there are a lot!) of our microservice producing a [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/) compliant API for your resources based on a simple configuration describing the domain. Find things such as [how to define your domain](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources#configurationdomainlisp), [how to filter](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources#basic-filtering), [how to paginate](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources#pagination) and a lot more.

You can also have a look at our previous blog posts [Generating a JSONAPI compliant API for your resources, part 1](https://mu.semte.ch/2017/07/27/generating-a-jsonapi-compliant-api-for-your-resources/) and [part 2](https://mu.semte.ch/2017/08/17/generating-a-jsonapi-compliant-api-for-your-resources-part-2/) to get started.
